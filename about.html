        <h2>Why We Built This App</h2>
        <p>
          In todayâ€™s digital world, passwords are the key to your personal and professional life.
          Unfortunately, many people still use weak or repeated passwords, making their data vulnerable.
          <strong>Vault</strong> was built to solve this â€” a safe, encrypted place where you can store
          all your passwords securely. 
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal is simple â€” to make password security easy, reliable, and personal.
          Every password stored in Vault is encrypted using advanced algorithms, ensuring that only
          <em>you</em> can access your data. No one else â€” not even us.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Trust Vault?</h2>
        <p>
          Vault provides industry-standard AES-256 encryption combined with your personal master key.
          Your information never leaves your control. You can relax knowing that your data is safe and private,
          protected from unauthorized access.
